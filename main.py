# Main algorithm for the weather forecasting app
# Weather Forecasting App
# Features: Users can check the current weather and forecast for their location. You could also add severe weather alerts.
# Learning Aspects:
# API integration (like OpenWeatherMap).
# Data parsing and display.
# Implementing alerts and notifications.
# Timeframe: 2-3 weeks.

# Steps
# Step 1: Graphical User interface (functionality for the buttons and windows) (using tkinter)
# Step 2: Use an API to retieve live global wether data (using OpenWeatherMap and pandas to format the information)
# Step 3: Alert and notifications opn weather updates using API's and pandas (use plyer for cross platform notifications)

# To use API libraries, download requests library to fetch wether data from the API
# To make the Graphical User interface, use the tkinter library 
# 

# Goals for tomorrow (Aug 18th)
# Learn about API's, how they're used and integrated into python, and how to get live updates
# and getting comfortable with them
# Future goals:
# Learn how to manage pandas, use pandas to control the data retrieved from the weather API
